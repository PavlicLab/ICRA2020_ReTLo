In prior work, we used a stochastic hybrid system model to characterize the observed team dynamics of ant group retrieval of a rigid load. We have also used macroscopic population dynamic models to design enzyme-inspired stochastic control policies that allocate a robotic swarm around multiple boundaries in a way that is robust to environmental variations. Here, we build on this prior work to synthesize stochastic robot attachment--detachment policies for tasks in which a robotic swarm must achieve non-uniform spatial distributions around multiple loads and transport them at a constant velocity. Three methods are presented for designing robot control policies that replicate the steady-state distributions, transient dynamics, and fluxes between states that we have observed in ant populations during group retrieval. The equilibrium population matching method can be used to achieve a desired transport team composition as quickly as possible; the transient matching method can control the transient population dynamics of the team while driving it to the desired composition; and the rate matching method regulates the rates at which robots join and leave a load during transport. We validate our model predictions in an agent-based simulation, verify that each controller design method produces successful transport of a load at a regulated velocity, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of each method.},

This approach requires no communication between robots, and yet stable team sizes are maintained around these regions. The control policy on each robot is implemented as a small set of event-triggered probabilistic rules for binding and unbinding to those regions. A macroscopic model of the robot swarm is used to design these probabilities to achieve a desired average allocation for each type of region. Our approach is similar to other stochastic multi-robot strategies in the literature; however, those approaches also incorporate internally generated timer events which have to be carefully tuned to match encounter rates generated by the external environment. In contrast, we avoid internally generated events, and so our approach produces stable equilibria that are invariant to changes in the environment. Additionally, for sufficiently large robot teams, the robot-controller design for each region type is independent of the design for any other region type. In this paper, we validate these theoretical results in simulation. Although this paper focuses on the application of allocating robots to boundaries, it more generally presents a new paradigm for robust stochastic programming based on using only externally generated events.},

Both models achieve consistent prediction on the chosen swarm metric and deliver a series of interesting qualitative and quantitative insights on further, counterintuitive, improvement of the distributed control algorithm. Modeling results were validated by experiments with one to twenty robots using a realistic simulator in the framework of a case study concerned with the inspection of a jet turbine.},

A group of finite state agents responds randomly to broadcast commands, each producing a state-dependent output that is measured in aggregate. Despite the lack of feedback signal and initial state information, this control architecture allows a single central controller to direct the aggregate output of the ensemble toward a desired value. First, the system is modeled as an ensemble of statistically independent, identically distributed, binary-state Markov processes with state transition probabilities designated by a central controller. Second, steady-state behavior, convergence rate, and variance of the aggregate output, i.e., the total number of recruited agents, are analyzed, and design trade-offs in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and the number of spurious transitions are made. Third, a limited feedback signal, only detecting if the output has reached a goal, is added to the system, and the recruitment controller is designed as a stochastic shortest path problem. Optimal convergence rate and associated transition probabilities are obtained. Finally, the theoretical results are verified and demonstrated with both numerical simulation and control of an artificial muscle actuator made up of 60 binary shape memory alloy motor units.},

We study the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy using a swarm of 100 Kilobots. We study the well-known speed versus accuracy trade-off analytically by developing a mean-field model. Compared to a previously published simpler method, our decision-making strategy shows a considerable speed-up but has lower accuracy. We analyze our decision-making strategy with particular focus on how the spatial density of robots impacts the dynamics of decisions. The number of neighboring robots is found to influence the speed and accuracy of the decision-making process. Larger neighborhoods speed up the decision but lower its accuracy. We observe that the parity of the neighborhood cardinality determines whether the system will over- or under-perform.},

We describe a novel, fully distributed collective decision-making strategy that only requires agents with minimal capabilities and is faster than previous approaches. We evaluate our strategy experimentally, using a swarm of 100 Kilobots, and we study it theoretically, using both continuum and finite-size models. We find that the main factor affecting the speed versus accuracy trade-off of our strategy is the agents' neighborhood size---i.e., the number of agents with whom the current opinion of each agent is shared.

We investigate two examples of swarm systems showing time-variant positive feedback: alignment in locust swarms and adaptive aggregation of swarms. We identify an influencing bias in the spatial distribution of agents compared to a well-mixed distribution and two features, percentage of aligned swarm members and neighborhood size, that allow us to model the time variance of feedbacks. We report an urn model that is capable of qualitatively representing all these relevant features. The increase in neighborhood sizes over time enables the swarm to lock in a highly aligned state but also allows for infrequent switching between lock-in states. We report similar occurrences of time-variant feedback in a second collective system to indicate the potential for generality of this phenomenon. Our study is concluded by applications of methods from renormalization group theory that allow us to focus on the neighborhood dynamics as scale transformations. Correlation lengths and critical exponents are determined empirically.},

The direction in which the object moves is controlled by the way in which the robots distribute themselves around its perimeter - if the robots dynamically reallocate themselves around the section of the object's perimeter that occludes their view of the goal, the object will eventually be transported to the goal. This strategy is fully distributed, and makes no use of communication between the robots. A controller based on this strategy was implemented on a swarm of 12 physical e-puck robots, and a systematic experiment with 30 randomized trials was performed. The object was successfully transported to the goal in all the trials. On average, the path traced by the object was about 8.4% longer than the shortest possible path.},

Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system.

By design, they can passively accumulate in tumors, selectively bind to targets in their environment, and deliver localized treatments. However, the penetration of targeted nanoparticles deep into tissue can be hindered by their slow diffusion and a high binding affinity. As a result, they often localize to areas around the vessels from which they extravasate, never reaching the deep-seeded tumor cells, thereby limiting their efficacy. To increase tissue penetration and cellular accumulation, we propose generalizable guidelines for nanoparticle design and validate them using two different computer models that capture the potency, motion, binding kinetics, and cellular internalization of targeted nanoparticles in a section of tumor tissue. One strategy that emerged from the models was delaying nanoparticle binding until after the nanoparticles have had time to diffuse deep into the tissue. Results show that nanoparticles that are designed according to these guidelines do not require fine-tuning of their kinetics or size and can be administered in lower doses than classical targeted nanoparticles for a desired tissue penetration in a large variety of tumor scenarios. In the future, similar models could serve as a testbed to explore engineered tissue-distributions that arise when large numbers of nanoparticles interact in a tumor environment.},

Using a simple model we show how information can be transferred within groups both without signalling and when group members do not know which individuals, if any, have information. We reveal that the larger the group the smaller the proportion of informed individuals needed to guide the group, and that only a very small proportion of informed individuals is required to achieve great accuracy. We also demonstrate how groups can make consensus decisions, even though informed individuals do not know whether they are in a majority or minority, how the quality of their information compares with that of others, or even whether there are any other informed individuals. Our model provides new insights into the mechanisms of effective leadership and decision-making in biological systems.},

How does the small minority of informed bees indicate the swarm's flight direction to the large majority of uninformed bees? Previous simulation studies have suggested two possible mechanisms of visual flight guidance: the informed bees guide by flying in the preferred direction but without an elevated speed (subtle guide hypothesis) or they guide by flying in the preferred direction and with an elevated speed (streaker bee hypothesis). We tested these hypotheses by performing a video analysis that enabled us to measure the flight directions and flight speeds of individual bees in a flying swarm. The distributions of flight speed as a function of flight direction have conspicuous peaks for bees flying toward the swarm's new home, especially for bees in the top of the swarm. This is strong support for the streaker bee hypothesis.},

AutoMoDe produces robot control software by selecting, instantiating, and combining preexisting parametric modules---the injected bias. The resulting control software is a probabilistic finite state machine in which the topology, the transition rules and the values of the parameters are obtained automatically via an optimization process that maximizes a task-specific objective function. As a proof of concept, we define AutoMoDe-Vanilla, which is a specialization of AutoMoDe for the e-puck robot. We use AutoMoDe-Vanilla to design the robot control software for two different tasks: aggregation and foraging. The results show that the control software produced by AutoMoDe-Vanilla (i) yields good results, (ii) appears to be robust to the so called reality gap, and (iii) is naturally human-readable.},

This is particularly true for collective and swarm robotics, in which the desired behavior of the group is an indirect result of the control and communication rules followed by each individual. However, the experimenter must make several arbitrary choices in setting up the evolutionary process, in order to define the correct selective pressures that can lead to the desired results. In some cases, only a deep understanding of the obtained results can point to the critical aspects that constrain the system, which can be later modified in order to re-engineer the evolutionary process towards better solutions. In this article, we discuss the problem of engineering the evolutionary machinery that can lead to the desired result in the swarm robotics context. We also present a case study about self-organizing synchronization in a swarm of robots, in which some arbitrarily chosen properties of the communication system hinder the scalability of the behavior to large groups. We show that by modifying the communication system, artificial evolution can synthesize behaviors that scale properly with the group size.},

We argue here that the ability to represent relevant features of the environment is the expected consequence of an adaptive process, give a formal definition of representation based on information theory, and quantify it with a measure R. To measure how R changes over time, we evolve two types of networks---an artificial neural network and a network of hidden Markov gates---to solve a categorization task using a genetic algorithm. We find that the capacity to represent increases during evolutionary adaptation and that agents form representations of their environment during their lifetime. This ability allows the agents to act on sensorial inputs in the context of their acquired representations and enables complex and context-dependent behavior. We examine which concepts (features of the environment) our networks are representing, how the representations are logically encoded in the networks, and how they form as an agent behaves to solve a task. We conclude that R should be able to quantify the representations within any cognitive system and should be predictive of an agent's long-term adaptive success.},

We present an Artificial Neural Tissue (ANT) architecture as a control system for autonomous multirobot excavation tasks. An ANT approach requires much less human supervision and pre-programmed human expertise than previous techniques. Only a single global fitness function and a set of allowable basis behaviors need be specified. An evolutionary (Darwinian) selection process is used to 'breed' controllers for the task at hand in simulation and the fittest controllers are transferred onto hardware for further validation and testing. ANT facilitates 'machine creativity', with the emergence of novel functionality through a process of self-organized task decomposition of mission goals. ANT based controllers are shown to exhibit self-organization, employ stigmergy (communication mediated through the environment) and make use of templates (unlabeled environmental cues). With lunar in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) efforts in mind, ANT controllers have been tested on a multirobot excavation task in which teams of robots with no explicit supervision can successfully avoid obstacles, interpret excavation blueprints, perform layered digging, avoid burying or trapping other robots and clear/maintain digging routes.},
