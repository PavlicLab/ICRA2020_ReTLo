This video first visualizes the motivation, experimental settings, data collection, and prediction outcomes with physical robotic platform, Thymio II. Recordings of moving robots could help better understand details about configurations of robots and environments used during experiments, such as linear/angular speeds, the distance between robotic agents, and the robot-to-arena size ratio. Viewers also could find the degree of randomness and flexibility induced in automatically planned trajectories of robot teams, to visually measure the difficulty of problem tackled. Furthermore, the video includes step-by-step explanations of iterative modular prediction, which is a fundamental method in the proposed framework for applications to larger robot teams without further training. Lastly, multiple prediction examples that are not introduced in the paper are also provided for better qualitative performance evaluation.
